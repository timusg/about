I am a Software Engineer/Manager by profession. I love [photography](https://500px.com/guptasumit){:target="_blank"}, chess, gaming, and travel.

I co-founded CodeIgnition, a premier DevOps and Automation startup in India. It got [acquired](https://inc42.com/flash-feed/go-jek-acqrs-c42-and-codeignition/){:target="_blank"} in 2016 by GOJEK, the most popular super app of Indonesia.

At GOJEK, being the part of a hyper-growth story from its infancy, I got to work on the reliability of 16+ products, scaling from few thousands to the millions of transactions.

I have a special interest in fitness and nutrition. I practice different genre of workouts including calisthenics, MMA and cross fit. I did 1.4 st transformation (100 days period) multiple times. Having a deep interest in fitness, I started a gourmet fitness food business with friends. After running it for 14 months, we closed it in late 2016.

I have a startup mindset, expertise in Infrastructure Automation and Tech Strategy. I believe in iterative evolution and excited about solving challenging problems by applying technology and analytical thinking.

I love learning new things, with interests in electronics, music, travel, culture and upcoming technology.
